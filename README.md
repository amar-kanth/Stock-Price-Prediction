# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Regression techniques to predict stock prices. The models were trained on the Tata dataset and demonstrated superior prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods.

## Goals
- Enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions using advanced machine learning techniques.
- Compare the performance of LSTM models and regression analysis.

## Development Process
1. **Data Collection**: Used the Tata dataset for stock price data.
2. **Model Implementation**: Implemented LSTM and Regression models using Python.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluated and compared the prediction accuracy of both models.

## Features
- **Improved Accuracy**: LSTM and Regression models provide higher prediction accuracy.
- **Model Comparison**: Detailed comparison of LSTM's performance against other models.
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of stock price data.

## Skills Used
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
